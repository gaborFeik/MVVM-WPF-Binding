# MVVM-WPF-Binding
Using MVVM pattern for creating bound elements as WPF

Changing from Element event reaction to binding.
I'm using Caliburn.Micro package paying attention for naming convention.
I bind ItemSource to Datagrid,Combobox,Listbox elements with DataTemplates.
There are 4 Views created with 4 corresponding ViewModels code behinds.
I also added the iTextSharp package to convert Model data to PDF.

I'm currently implementing a Repository system with entities onto an Azure SQL db.
